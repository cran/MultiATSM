#' Theoretically, this function should be functionally equivalent to log(det(A)). However, it avoids the
#' overflow/underflow problems that are likely to happen when applying det to large matrices.

#' The key idea is based on the mathematical fact that the determinant of a triangular matrix equals the
#' product of its diagonal elements. Hence, the matrix's log-determinant is equal to the sum of their logarithm
#' values. By keeping all computations in log-scale, the problem of underflow/overflow caused by product of
#' many numbers can be effectively circumvented. The implementation is based on LU factorization.
